# main-project

**Description:**
This project involves the design and development of an Android-based College Bus Tracking System aimed at improving the efficiency and transparency of student transportation. Built using Android Studio and the Kotlin programming language, the mobile application offers real-time tracking of buses, seat availability updates, and route management.
The system integrates GPS technology and the Google Maps API to provide students with live location updates, thereby reducing wait times and ensuring a more predictable commute. A REST API facilitates smooth communication between the mobile front-end and a MySQL database-powered backend, where information on buses, users, and routes is stored and managed.
Different modules are designed for students, drivers, and administrators. Students can track bus locations in real-time, drivers can update status and seat availability, and administrators can manage users, schedules, and routes from a central dashboard.
Security is maintained through user authentication and secure login, and the architecture is modular and scalable to allow for future improvements. Planned features include AI-based route optimization, multilingual support, and an emergency alert system. Development and testing were conducted using JDK, SDK, and the AVD emulator in a Windows 11 environment.
The application minimizes manual intervention, enhances transportation transparency, and promotes the digital transformation of institutional commuting systems.
